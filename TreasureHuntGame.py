# # Treasure Hunt Game Notebook
# 
# ## Read and Review Your Starter Code
# The theme of this project is a popular treasure hunt game in which the player needs to find the treasure before the pirate does. While you will not be developing the entire game, you will write the part of the game that represents the intelligent agent, which is a pirate in this case. The pirate will try to find the optimal path to the treasure using deep Q-learning. 
# 
# You have been provided with two Python classes and this notebook to help you with this assignment. The first class, TreasureMaze.py, represents the environment, which includes a maze object defined as a matrix. The second class, GameExperience.py, stores the episodes â€“ that is, all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state. This is later used by the agent for learning by experience, called "exploration". This notebook shows how to play a game. Your task is to complete the deep Q-learning implementation for which a skeleton implementation has been provided. The code blocs you will need to complete has #TODO as a header.
# 
# First, read and review the next few code and instruction blocks to understand the code that you have been given.

    img = plt.imshow(canvas, interpolation='none', cmap='gray')
    return img


# The pirate agent can move in four directions: left, right, up, and down. 
# 
# While the agent primarily learns by experience through exploitation, often, the agent can choose to explore the environment to find previously undiscovered paths. This is called "exploration" and is defined by epsilon. This value is typically a lower value such as 0.1, which means for every ten attempts, the agent will attempt to learn by experience nine times and will randomly explore a new path one time. You are encouraged to try various values for the exploration factor and see how the algorithm performs.

# In[4]:


LEFT = 0
UP = 1
RIGHT = 2
DOWN = 3


# Exploration factor
epsilon = 0.1

# Actions dictionary

# In[5]:

canvas, reward, game_over = qmaze.act(DOWN)
print("reward=", reward)
show(qmaze)


# This function simulates a full game based on the provided trained model. The other parameters include the TreasureMaze object and the starting position of the pirate.

# ## Test Your Model
# 
# Now we will start testing the deep Q-learning implementation. To begin, select **Cell**, then **Run All** from the menu bar. This will run your notebook. As it runs, you should see output begin to appear beneath the next few cells. The code below creates an instance of TreasureMaze.

# In[10]:


qmaze = TreasureMaze(maze)
show(qmaze)


# In the next code block, you will build your model and train it using deep Q-learning. Note: This step takes several minutes to fully run.

# In[11]:


model = build_model(maze)
qtrain(model, maze, epochs=1000, max_memory=8*maze.size, data_size=32)


# This cell will check to see if the model passes the completion check. Note: This could take several minutes.

# In[12]:


completion_check(model, qmaze)
show(qmaze)


# This cell will test your model for one game. It will start the pirate at the top-left corner and run play_game. The agent should find a path from the starting position to the target (treasure). The treasure is located in the bottom-right corner.

# In[13]:


pirate_start = (0, 0)
play_game(model, qmaze, pirate_start)
show(qmaze)


# ## Save and Submit Your Work
# After you have finished creating the code for your notebook, save your work. Make sure that your notebook contains your name in the filename (e.g. Doe_Jane_ProjectTwo.ipynb). This will help your instructor access and grade your work easily. Download a copy of your IPYNB file and submit it to Brightspace. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook in Apporto Tutorial if you need help with these tasks.
